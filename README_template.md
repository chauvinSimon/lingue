I am looking for words whose **translations** in French ( :fr: ), Italian ( :it: ), German ( :de: ), English ( :uk: ), and Spanish ( :es: ) **look and sound all very different**.

Organisation:
- The best examples are collected in the section [:1st_place_medal: FIRST RANK](#1st_place_medal-first-rank).
- The rest in [:2nd_place_medal: SECOND RANK](#2nd_place_medal-second-rank).

PS: Perhaps this other personal project, this time searching for **French and Italian** words that **sound similar but have different genders**, will interest you: **[illalelo ( :fr: :it: )](https://github.com/chauvinSimon/illalelo/blob/main/README.md)**.
